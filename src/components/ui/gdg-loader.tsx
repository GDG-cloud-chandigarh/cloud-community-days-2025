/*
  The GDG mark as SVG, in the logo's own pixel units (fitted to the GDG logo
  artwork), so the 1.8:1 aspect and 35.7 degree tilt are exact. Shared with
  the DevFest Chandigarh site.

  Construction: each chevron is two equal capsules sharing an end point at
  the vertex, one drawn over the other. Red and yellow only look short
  because blue and green cover their first stretch; drawing them the full
  length is what gives the sharp, flush point where the two meet.

  Each capsule is a rect with fully rounded ends, grown by the outline width
  because an SVG stroke straddles the edge and would otherwise eat into the
  colour. Draw order: red and yellow first, then blue and green over them.

/*
  Grouped by chevron, because the mark is built from overlap: any fade or
  scale applied to one capsule exposes the hidden stretch of the one beneath
  it. Each group animates as a unit, so its tuck stays intact at every frame.
  Within a group the tucked capsule is listed first so it draws underneath.
